# this is an example showing how perspective works in css where we can see a parent and a child which is div and image and the image is animated showing persective ..

The perspective property in CSS is used to create a 3D perspective effect on elements and is essential for making 3D transformations like rotations appear more realistic. It defines the distance between the viewer and the 3D-transformed element, determining how much depth or "vanishing point" there is in the 3D space.

Here's how it works and how you can use it:

1. Understanding perspective: The perspective property sets the distance from the viewer to the z-plane (the plane where elements are transformed). Smaller values create a stronger perspective effect, making the transformed elements appear larger and closer, while larger values make them appear smaller and farther away.

2. Applying perspective: You apply the perspective property to a parent element that contains the child elements you want to transform in 3D space. The child elements will respect the perspective of their parent.

3. Creating 3D transformations: When you apply 3D transformations like rotateX, rotateY, or rotateZ to the child elements, they will appear to rotate in 3D space with respect to the perspective set on their parent.

In code example:
.parent {
perspective: 1000px; /_ This sets the perspective to 1000 pixels _/
}

This means that the 3D transformations applied to the child img elements will be based on a perspective of 1000 pixels, creating a moderately strong 3D effect.

You can further adjust the perspective value to see different 3D effects. A smaller value like 10px would create a much stronger 3D effect, making the rotation appear more dramatic and exaggerated. A larger value like 5000px would make the 3D effect subtler.

In summary, the perspective property sets the depth or vanishing point for 3D transformations. Smaller values make elements appear closer and create stronger 3D effects, while larger values make elements appear farther away and create subtler 3D effects. Adjust the perspective value to achieve the desired 3D effect for your project.
